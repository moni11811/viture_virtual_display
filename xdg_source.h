 * @brief Captures the current root window (entire screen) using XDG ScreenCast Portal.
 * 
 * This function operates by establishing a ScreenCast session with the XDG Desktop Portal.
 * It uses the org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast interface to create a streaming session
 * that provides real-time screen content via PipeWire. The function initializes the
 * screencast session on first call and reuses it for subsequent calls, providing
 * continuous frame data without user interaction.
 * 
 * The caller is responsible for calling free_xdg_frame_request() on the returned pointer
 * when the frame data is no longer needed. Call cleanup_screencast_session() when
 * the application is shutting down to properly clean up the screencast session.
 * 
 * @return XDGFrameRequest* A pointer to an XDGFrameRequest structure containing the
 *         pixel data and metadata if successful, or NULL on failure (e.g., portal error,
 *         timeout, PipeWire connection error).
 *         If non-NULL, frame_request->data will point to the allocated pixel buffer.
 *         frame_request->success will be TRUE if data was populated.
